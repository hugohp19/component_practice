      <p>I'm the best there is at what I do but what I do best isn't very nice. Sometimes, when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry. Nature Made Me A Freak. Man Made Me A Weapon. And God Made It Last Too Long. The Pain Lets You Know Youâ€™re Still Alive. It will heal. They always heal. And quickly.</p>
